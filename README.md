# Home-Server

A log of my home server build process and setup.
I am keeeping a log of the things that I try, so that I am able to refer back to them later If I change something.

### Software Choice

#### Fedora Server + K3S

I decided to use K3S as I wanted to learn how to manage my own cluster. It would also allow me to create a HA server.
Some of the notes of setting up K3S can be found in the K3S folder. However, I have decided to switch to proxmox for the time being as it is much simpler to use. Once I have a better understanding of that, then I will hopefully move back to Kubernetes.

#### Proxmox

See my notes in the Proxmox folder
