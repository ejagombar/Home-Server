# Home-Server
#### A collection of notes, tutorials and documentation relating to my home server.

I wanted to keep track of the things that I am doing on my home server so I have documentation to refer back to, in case I ever need it. I also hope that it will help me better learn the tools that I am using by making tutorials and notes about them.
