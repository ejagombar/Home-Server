<!-- I decided to use K3S as I wanted to learn how to manage my own cluster. It would also allow me to create a HA server. -->
<!-- Some of the notes of setting up K3S can be found in the K3S folder. However, I have decided to switch to proxmox for the time being as it is much simpler to use. Once I have a better understanding of that, then I will hopefully move back to Kubernetes. -->

### 3D CAD Model

The case was designed in Fusion360 and aimed to combine the four servers, power supplies, cables, and network switch into a single enclosure. The structure was made as configurable as possible, with all the main dimensions defined by variables. The case is modular, and more servers can be added easily. The fusion360 files for the case can be found in this folder.

### Final Construction
The case was printed in PLA plastic and assembled (with great difficulty - some adjustments need to be made) with some M5 Hex bolts.
