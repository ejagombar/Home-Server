# Proxmox Setup

 - Proxmox was installed on each of the ThinkCentre PCs and they were configured as a cluster.
 - I have not set up high availability yet althought I would like to at some point.

So far I have deployed several services on my server, using a mixture of Linux Containers (LXC) and Virtual machines. This included:

- WireGuard VPN - to allow remote access to my home network.
- Go UDP Server - as prt of my Gesture Controlled Hand Project.
- NGINX-RTMP Video Streaming Server - as prt of my Gesture Controlled Hand Project.
- Spanner Website - Deployed my website locally. For more info see [here](/Spanner/overview.md).
