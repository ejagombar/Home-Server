# K3S Setup

Originally, I planned to run K3S on my cluster to learn more about Kubernetes, however it was a lot more complicated to set up than I first realised and I wanted to get services running on my server quickly. So instead, I switched to Proxmox. I made some notes on how to set up K3S so hopefully I will come back to it at some point.
